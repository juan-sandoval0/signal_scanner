# Startup Signal Scanner

Generates a brief on any startup from any company website using GPT-4o, BeautifulSoup, and web data!

## What It Does

Lets you input the URL of any startupâ€™s website and returns a brief by:

- Scraping the landing page and important subpages (like About, Team, Careers)
- Classifying relevant links using OpenAI API
- Extracting TechCrunch articles using Google + BeautifulSoup
- Generating a summary report using GPT-4o

I wanted to simulate how an analyst or early-stage investor might summarize the company at a glance.
